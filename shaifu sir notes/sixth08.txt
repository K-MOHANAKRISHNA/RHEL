three types of users
root user(#)
standard user($)
system user(is like standard user and having only some permissions)
(do not have any interacting logins)

/bin /sbin are the home directories of sysytem users


=======================================
ps (shows process running)

ps -a

ps -au

ps -u

id
//always userid for root is 0 //uid means userid //gid - group id

//standard user ids start from 1001,1002,......

in passwd 
each line contains 7 parts
username : x(password):userid:groupid:description:home directory:login info(shell prompt)

in /etc shadow fgile will bethere where passwords will be there(in coded)

/etc cat group   //it shows username password and gid

in intervies they wont ask commands they will ask about directories and use of that
in that what it contains  (directory navigation and settings) 

su - user account //su - tse
//to give sudo access to the standard user

cd sudoers.d/   //in etc
cat > username
username	ALL=(ALL)	All

if yopu give permissions to the standard user as sudo then only he can have permissions as a temporary root acount
otherwise it will be act as standars account
