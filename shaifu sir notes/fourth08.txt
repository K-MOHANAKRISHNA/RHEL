lab. 
Create six files with names of the form songX.mp3.
Create six files with names of the form snapX.jpg.
Create six files with names of the form filmX.avi.
In each set, replace X with the numbers 1 through 6.

From your home directory, move the song files into your Music subdirectory, the snapshot
files into your Pictures subdirectory, and the movie files into your Videos subdirectory.

In your home directory, create three subdirectories for organizing your files into projects.
Call these directories friends, family, and work. Create all three with one command.

Change to your home directory. Attempt to delete both the family and friends projects with a
single rmdir command.

Use another command rm -r that will succeed in deleting both the family and friends folders.
